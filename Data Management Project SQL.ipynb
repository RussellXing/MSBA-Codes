    "# Project 02 - Due Friday, October 13 at 12pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objectives*: Design a relational database schema for transaction processing. Use SQL to load the data into the database and retrieve information from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with SQL queries, shell commands, diagrams and markdown cells.  The notebook itself should be completely reproducible (using AWS EC2 instance based on the provided AMI) from start to finish; another person should be able to use the code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking at each major step in each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Attestation*: **Work in groups**.  At the end of your submitted notebook, identify the work each partner performed and attest that each contributed substantially to the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deadline*: Friday, October 13, 12pm.  One member of each group must submit your notebook to Blackboard; you should not submit it separately."

    "The city is going to launch a new bike sharing system. Your task is to design a relational database to support its operation. The bike sharing system works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Riders can buy annual, semiannual or monthly membership. We need to have a record of each member's name and address in order to send them a key. Keys can be used to check out bikes at any bike station. Members have the option to renew their memberships before they expire. A member becomes inactive when his or her membership expires, therefore we need to know when their memberships expire. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each bike station has a pubic name (i.e. \"18th & C St NW\"). Occasionally in response to public requests, stations can be renamed. Each bike station have been built with a number of docking points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each bike is either serviceable or disabled. If it is disabled, it is removed from the station for repair.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For simplicity's sake, each serviceable bike is either docked at a station or checked out by a member. If it is checked out by a member, the system needs to know who has checked it out and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your database should minimally support the above requirements."

    "\n",
    "Based on what you read above, design a relational database schema consisting of *at least* 3 tables. Document your schema with a schema diagram.  There are several tools available for this, such as [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings/) and Microsoft Visio. Make sure to include the schema diagram in your submission. Embed and display the diagram in your notebook. **Discuss your major design decisions.** Be aware that your schema is designed to support transaction processing and should be optimized for writes and data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for the following when grade this part of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All required attributes are recorded.\n",
    "* In the schema diagram, all primary keys are underlined. Directed lines are drawn from the foreign keys to the primary keys.\n",
    "* Your database schema should be designed to promite data consistency and integrity and reduce the duplication of data. Strive for 3NF.\n",
    "* Your database schema should be designed to support the requirements described in Part 1, as well as problems in Part 4 and 5.\n",
    "* Key design decisions are discussed and documented in Markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
