To repreduce my shiny app, please follow the steps below.

#### Files that need downloading

* Virginia election raw data [https://apps.elections.virginia.gov/SBE_CSV/ELECTIONS/ELECTIONRESULTS/2017/]

And I saved it as "result.txt"

* Geojson file for map plotting [http://catalog.opendata.city/dataset/virginia-counties-polygon/resource/9dd40375-d30e-41cc-9e8e-e6fb26b42bf9]

Please put these files with R code and R Markdown files (Introduction.rmd, Workflow.rmd) into one file folder and set the work directory as this folder.

#### R libraries that need downloading

* shiny
* leaflet
* dplyr
* geojsonio
* ggplot2
* shinythemes
* rmarkdown

Then we can run the "individual product" to use the shiny app.
