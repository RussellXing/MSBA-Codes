    "*Grading criteria*: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered with clear responses, with shell commands and markdown cells explaining your work as appropriate in the cells provided (as more as needed).  The notebook itself should be completely reproducible (using AWS an EC2 instance based on the class AMI) from start to finish; another person should be able to use the code to obtain the same results as yours.  Note that you will receive no more than partial credit if you do not add text/markdown cells explaining your thinking where required.\n",
